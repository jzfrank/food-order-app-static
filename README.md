# food-order-app-static
My first non-trivial react app. It is a food ordering app, but with only front end.

It used the following react concepts: 
- Hooks: useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext, 
- Fragment
- module.css (localization of css styles)
- createPortal with modal

Let's start with learning from others' coding and thinking process. Hopefully ending with writing nontrivial apps completely on one's own.
